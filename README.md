### 1. COVID-19 Global Dashboard (Tableau Project)

I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize global COVID-19 data, covering total cases, deaths, recoveries, and regional breakdowns. The dashboard integrates real-time data to provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact worldwide.

Key Features:

Global Overview: Displays total confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates across countries and continents.
Trend Analysis: Interactive line charts to track the rise and fall of cases and deaths over time.
Geographical Insights: Heat maps and bubble charts highlighting hotspots and regions with rising or declining cases.
Country Comparisons: Filters to compare COVID-19 metrics between countries and regions.
Dynamic Visualizations: Real-time updates with clear and intuitive visual designs for easy interpretation of complex data.
